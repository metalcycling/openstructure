Evaluate model against reference 

Example: ost compare-structures -m model.pdb -r reference.cif

Loads the structures and performs basic cleanup:

 * Assign elements according to the PDB Chemical Component Dictionary
 * Map nonstandard residues to their parent residues as defined by the PDB
   Chemical Component Dictionary, e.g. phospho-serine => serine
 * Remove hydrogens
 * Remove OXT atoms
 * Remove unknown atoms, i.e. atoms that are not expected according to the PDB
   Chemical Component Dictionary
 * Select for peptide/nucleotide residues

The cleaned structures are optionally dumped using -d/--dump-structures

Output is written in JSON format (default: out.json). In case of no additional
options, this is a dictionary with 8 keys describing model/reference comparison:

 * "reference_chains": Chain names of reference
 * "model_chains": Chain names of model
 * "chem_groups": Groups of polypeptides/polynucleotides from reference that
   are considered chemically equivalent. You can derive stoichiometry from this.
   Contains only chains that are considered in chain mapping, i.e. pass a
   size threshold (defaults: 10 for peptides, 4 for nucleotides).
 * "chem_mapping": List of same length as "chem_groups". Assigns model chains to
   the respective chem group. Again, only contains chains that are considered
   in chain mapping.
 * "chain_mapping": A dictionary with reference chain names as keys and the
   mapped model chain names as values. Missing chains are either not mapped
   (but present in "chem_groups", "chem_mapping") or were not considered in
   chain mapping (short peptides etc.)
 * "aln": Pairwise sequence alignment for each pair of mapped chains in fasta
   format.
 * "inconsistent_residues": List of strings that represent name mismatches of
   aligned residues in form
   <trg_cname>.<trg_rnum>.<trg_ins_code>-<mdl_cname>.<mdl_rnum>.<mdl_ins_code>.
   Inconsistencies may lead to corrupt results but do not abort the program.
   Program abortion in these cases can be enforced with
   -ec/--enforce-consistency.
 * "status": SUCCESS if everything ran through. In case of failure, the only
   content of the JSON output will be \"status\" set to FAILURE and an
   additional key: "traceback".

The following additional keys store relevant input parameters to reproduce
results:

 * "model"
 * "reference"
 * "fault_tolerant"
 * "model_biounit"
 * "reference_biounit"
 * "residue_number_alignment"
 * "enforce_consistency"
 * "cad_exec"
 * "usalign_exec"
 * "lddt_no_stereochecks"
 * "min_pep_length"
 * "min_nuc_length"

The pairwise sequence alignments are computed with Needleman-Wunsch using
BLOSUM62 (NUC44 for nucleotides). Many benchmarking scenarios preprocess the
structures to ensure matching residue numbers (CASP/CAMEO). In these cases,
enabling -rna/--residue-number-alignment is recommended.

Each score is opt-in and can be enabled with optional arguments.

Example to compute global and per-residue lDDT values as well as QS-score:

ost compare-structures -m model.pdb -r reference.cif --lddt --local-lddt \
--qs-score

Example to inject custom chain mapping

ost compare-structures -m model.pdb -r reference.cif -c A:B B:A
