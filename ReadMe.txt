================= OpenStructure molecular modelling framework ==================

OpenStructure provides a modular, flexible, molecular modelling environment
which allows to integrate, process and visualize information of different origin
such as sequences, alignments and 3D structures.

Please refer to www.openstructure.org for more information and documentation.

Thank you for you interest and enjoy the straightforward way of handling protein
structure data!
