class LigandScorer:
    """ Scorer class to compute various small molecule ligand (non polymer) scores.

    .. note ::
      Extra requirements:

      - Python modules `numpy` and `networkx` must be available
        (e.g. use ``pip install numpy networkx``)

    At the moment, two scores are available:

    * lDDT-PLI, that looks at the conservation of protein-ligand contacts
      with :class:`lDDT <ost.mol.alg.lddt.lDDTScorer>`.
    * Binding-site superposed, symmetry-corrected RMSD that assesses the
      accuracy of the ligand pose (BiSyRMSD, hereinafter referred to as RMSD).

    Both scores involve local chain mapping of the reference binding site
    onto the model, symmetry-correction, and finally assignment (mapping)
    of model and target ligands, as described in (Manuscript in preparation).

    The binding site is defined based on a radius around the target ligand
    in the reference structure only. It only contains protein and nucleic
    acid chains that pass the criteria for the
    :class:`chain mapping <ost.mol.alg.chain_mapping>`. This means ignoring
    other ligands, waters, short polymers as well as any incorrectly connected
    chains that may be in proximity.

    Results are available as matrices (`(lddt_pli|rmsd)_matrix`), where every
    target-model score is reported in a matrix; as `(lddt_pli|rmsd)` where
    a model-target assignment has been determined (see below) and reported in
    a dictionary; and as (`(lddt_pli|rmsd)_details`) methods, which report
    additional details about different aspects of the scoring such as chain
    mapping.

    The behavior of chain mapping and ligand assignment can be controlled
    with the `global_chain_mapping` and `rmsd_assignment` arguments.

    By default, chain mapping is performed locally, ie. only within the
    binding site. As a result, different ligand scores can correspond to
    different chain mappings. This tends to produce more favorable scores,
    especially in large, partially regular oligomeric complexes.
    Setting `global_chain_mapping=True` enforces a single global chain mapping,
    as per :meth:`ost.mol.alg.chain_mapping.ChainMapper.GetMapping`.
    Note that this global chain mapping currently ignores non polymer entities
    such as small ligands, and may result in overly pessimistic scores.

    By default, target-model ligand assignments are computed independently
    for the RMSD and lDDT-PLI scores. For RMSD, each model ligand is uniquely
    assigned to a target ligand, starting from the "best" possible mapping
    (lowest RMSD) and using each target and model ligand in a single
    assignment. Ties are resolved by best (highest) lDDT-PLI. Similarly,
    for lDDT-PLI, the assignment is based on the highest lDDT-PLI, and ties
    broken by lowest RMSD. Setting `rmsd_assignment=True` forces a single
    ligand assignment, based on RMSD only. Ties are broken arbitrarily.

    By default, only exact matches between target and model ligands are
    considered. This is a problem when the target only contains a subset
    of the expected atoms (for instance if atoms are missing in an
    experimental structure, which often happens in the PDB). With
    `substructure_match=True`, complete model ligands can be scored against
    partial target ligands. One problem with this approach is that it is
    very easy to find good matches to small, irrelevant ligands like EDO, CO2
    or GOL. To counter that, the assignment algorithm considers the coverage,
    expressed as the fraction of atoms of the model ligand atoms covered in the
    target. Higher coverage matches are prioritized, but a match with a better
    score will be preferred if it falls within a window of `coverage_delta`
    (by default 0.2) of a worse-scoring match. As a result, for instance,
    with a delta of 0.2, a low-score match with coverage 0.96 would be
    preferred to a high-score match with coverage 0.90.

    Assumptions:

    The class generally assumes that the
    :attr:`~ost.mol.ResidueHandle.is_ligand` property is properly set on all
    the ligand atoms, and only ligand atoms. This is typically the case for
    entities loaded from mmCIF (tested with mmCIF files from the PDB and
    SWISS-MODEL). Legacy PDB files must contain `HET` headers (which is usually
    the case for files downloaded from the PDB but not elsewhere).

    The class doesn't perform any cleanup of the provided structures.
    It is up to the caller to ensure that the data is clean and suitable for
    scoring. :ref:`Molck <molck>` should be used with extra
    care, as many of the options (such as `rm_non_std` or `map_nonstd_res`) can
    cause ligands to be removed from the structure. If cleanup with Molck is
    needed, ligands should be kept aside and passed separately. Non-ligand residues
    should be valid compounds with atom names following the naming conventions
    of the component dictionary. Non-standard residues are acceptable, and if
    the model contains a standard residue at that position, only atoms with
    matching names will be considered.

    Unlike most of OpenStructure, this class does not assume that the ligands
    (either in the model or the target) are part of the PDB component
    dictionary. They may have arbitrary residue names. Residue names do not
    have to match between the model and the target. Matching is based on
    the calculation of isomorphisms which depend on the atom element name and
    atom connectivity (bond order is ignored).
    It is up to the caller to ensure that the connectivity of atoms is properly
    set before passing any ligands to this class. Ligands with improper
    connectivity will lead to bogus results.

    Note, however, that atom names should be unique within a residue (ie two
    distinct atoms cannot have the same atom name).

    This only applies to the ligand. The rest of the model and target
    structures (protein, nucleic acids) must still follow the usual rules and
    contain only residues from the compound library.

    Although it isn't a requirement, hydrogen atoms should be removed from the
    structures. Here is an example code snippet that will perform a reasonable
    cleanup. Keep in mind that this is most likely not going to work as
    expected with entities loaded from PDB files, as the `is_ligand` flag is
    probably not set properly.

    Here is a snippet example of how to use this code::

        keyed by model ligand (chain name, :class:`~ost.mol.ResNum`).

        The assignment for the lDDT-PLI score is used (and is controlled
        by the `rmsd_assignment` argument).

        Each item contains a string from a controlled dictionary
        about the reason for the absence of assignment.
        A human-readable description can be obtained from the
        :attr:`unassigned_model_ligand_descriptions` property.
        Currently, the following reasons are reported:

        * `no_ligand`: there was no ligand in the target.
        * `disconnected`: the ligand graph is disconnected.
        * `binding_site`: a potential assignment was found in the target, but
          there were no polymer residues in proximity of the ligand in the
          target.
        * `model_representation`: a potential assignment was found in the target,
          but no representation of the binding site was found in the model.
          (I.e. the binding site was not modeled. Remember: the binding site
          is defined in the target structure, the position of the model ligand
          itself is ignored at this point.)
        * `identity`: the ligand was not found in the target (by graph
          isomorphism). Check your ligand connectivity, and enable the
          `substructure_match` option if the target ligand is incomplete.
        * `stoichiometry`: there was a possible assignment in the target, but
          the model target was already assigned to a different model ligand.
          This indicates different stoichiometries.
        * `symmetries`: too many symmetries were found (by graph isomorphisms).
          Increase `max_symmetries`.

        Some of these reasons can be overlapping, but a single reason will be
        reported.
