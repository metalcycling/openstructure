Changes in Release 2.6.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Reporting of unassigned ligands in the LigandScorer.
 * Experimental support for V3000 SDF files.
 * Rotamer based compression in OMF file format.
 * Chain mapping updates. Default chain mapping strategy now uses increased
   sampling - only marginal runtime increase.
 * The compound library now knows about SMILES strings, atom charges, and
   contain information that a compound is obsolete (including the replacement,
   if available). Compound libraries created by OST 1.5.0 or later can still be
   read (SMILES will be empty, charges set to 0, no information about the
   obsolete status of compounds, with warnings). Older files are no
   longer supported.
 * New FindCompounds method of CompoundLib to query compounds by SMILES
   string, InChI code, InChI key or formula.
 * The compound library now reads the "InChI=" part of InChI codes.
 * Several bug fixes and improvements.

Changes in Release 2.5.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * A default compound library is set and the rule-base processor is set as the
   default processor when the ost module is imported. As a result, OpenStructure
   will behave more like a script run with the `ost` command in python scripts,
   Jupyter notebooks, ipython sessions, etc.
 * Global chain mapping and assignment based on RMSD only are available for
   ligand scoring (both with the action and module).
 * Additional chain and residue properties are read from mmCIF allowing basic
   mapping between label and author chain and residue numbers.
 * USalign support - as binding that calls external USalign executable or
   direct injection of macromolecules on the C++ level.
 * Added functionality in compare-structures action: backbone only lDDT,
   flag to disable stereochemistry checks for lDDT, TMscore (including
   associated chain mapping) computed by USalign, make residues/atoms uniquely
   identifiable (also considering residue number insertion codes).
 * Read atom charges if present from PDB/mmCIF/SDF files
 * Several bug fixes and improvements.

Changes in Release 2.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Add fast and flexible lDDT implementation. The new code is purely Python
   based, natively supports complexes and is able to score DNA/RNA. The
   deprecated lDDT implementation remains for consistency.
 * Add algorithms to establish one to one mappings between chains in a reference
   structure and a model. Chain mappings can be derived by optimizing oligomeric
   lDDT, RMSD or QS-score. 
 * Substitution matrixes for RNA/DNA to compute alignments: seq.alg.IDENTITY and
   seq.alg.NUC44.
 * Add binding to DockQ (https://github.com/bjornwallner/DockQ) as well as an
   OpenStructure specific implementation of it. Also allows to extract CAPRI
   specific oligo scores (fnat, fnonnat, irmsd, lrmsd etc.)
 * Reimplentation of QS-score in mol.alg.qsscore. Implements speedups and
   heavy caching which benefits heavy enumeration approaches in chain mapping.
 * Stereochemistry related algorithms in mol.alg.stereochemistry. Identifies 
   clashes and non-sensible bond lengths/angles based on parameterizations from
   CCP4 MON_LIB.
 * Add non-polymer/small molecule ligand scoring algorithm with lDDT-PLI and
   symmetry-corrected ligand RMSD scores that were used in CASP15.
 * Better compression in OMF structure format.
 * Two central scoring objects to access to all OpenStructure specific scoring
   capabilities. Tertiary and quaternary structures and interactions, including
   required pre-processing of model/reference (cleanup, stereochemistry checks,
   chain mapping etc.) with mol.alg.scoring.Scorer.
   Non-polymer/small molecule ligands with mol.alg.ligand_scoring.LigandScorer.
 * Re-write of compare-structures action to include newly developed chain
   mapping and scores. The old action is available as compare-structures-legacy.
 * Add compare-ligand-structures action which computes lDDT-PLI and
   symmetry-corrected ligand RMSD scores in protein complexes.
 * Several minor bug fixes and improvements.

   Format)

   ost.bindings.dssp.AssignDSSP still exists with the "old" interface but mimics
   the equivalent behaviour with the OpenStructure internal secondary structure
   and solvent accessibility algorithms.
 * mol.alg.PDBize does not turn plain polymer chains (not marked peptide or
   nucleotide) into ligand chains anymore
 * Remove ENABLE_IMG flag in cmake build system - img module is always built now
 * Several minor bug fixes and improvements.

Changes in Release 2.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * Introduced CreateMeanlDDTHA function to evaluate the consistency of a
   structure with a full ensemble of structures.
 * FindMembrane algorithm returns additional intermediate results.
 * Detect Boost and Python using functionality provided by CMake instead of our 
   own code. You might have to adapt CMake flags when building OpenStructure to 
   variables specified here: 
   https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindPython.html

    previousely imported from ost.conop are now to be imported from ost.mol.alg.
  * Removed habit of changing secondary structure of entities when loading
    from mmCIF PDB files. Before, OST would turn secondary structure 'EEH'
    into 'ECH' to make it look nicer in DNG. Now, 'EEH' stays 'EEH'.
  * Added Molck API to the ost.mol.alg module.
